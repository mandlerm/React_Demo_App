# React Demo Project

This project is a demo project that demonstrates how to use a set of common tools to build testable and maintainable projects. You will find a small GraphQl server that provides data to the client. The client is bootstarted with creat react app.

## React Client

The client orginizes its folders around feature areas instead of pages. It shows how to build your own set of components instead of using off the self libraries like Bootstrap, Matrial, Foundation, etc. Using Storybook the client has a style guide that is shared and used to communicate avaiable components between developers. I tried to use HOCs as much as possible. This makes each component easier to test. 

Some of libraries used to help build and test components are listed below.

- Styled Components
- Recompose
- Storybook
-
